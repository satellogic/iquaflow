============

The **iquaflow** software allows to measure quality of images according to the prediction accuracy of different deep learning algorithms trained on them.

A core use cas has been the evaluation of the image quality from satellite sensors after being compressed and restored. This includes analyzing to what extent the images can be modified so that they do not suffer a significant deterioration.
